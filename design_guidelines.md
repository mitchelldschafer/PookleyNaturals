# Lunara Naturals Landing Page - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based**: Inspired by Aesop, Ritual, and Moon Juice aesthetics - zen, nurturing, rooted in nature with morning ritual inspiration, soft light, and balance.

## Color Palette
- **Warm Neutrals**: Beige, cream, sage green, muted blush
- **Philosophy**: Calming, natural tones that evoke earth, plants, and gentle morning light
- No harsh contrasts - maintain soft, harmonious color relationships throughout

## Typography
- **Headlines**: Soft serif font (elegant, trustworthy) - use Google Fonts like Cormorant Garamond, Crimson Pro, or Lora
- **Body Text**: Rounded sans-serif (modern, friendly) - use Google Fonts like DM Sans, Nunito Sans, or Outfit
- **Hierarchy**: Keep sentences short, rhythmic, and soothing in tone

## Layout & Spacing
- **Spacing System**: Use Tailwind units of 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 for consistent rhythm
- **Mobile-First**: All sections must be fully responsive and optimized for mobile viewing first
- **Centered Layouts**: Hero and main content areas use centered alignment for zen aesthetic

## Background Textures
Add subtle watercolor or linen textures for visual depth without overwhelming the clean design. Apply these as overlays or section backgrounds.
