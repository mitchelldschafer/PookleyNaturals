Prompt:
Build a new page for Lunara Naturals called “Our Blends” — a calm, elegant, product showcase page that continues the same brand voice and design as the home page (warm neutrals, soft greens, poetic copy, and a balanced layout).

Page purpose: help visitors explore the three core supplements — Glow Ritual, Calm Restore, and Vital Greens — each with photos, descriptions, and gentle calls to action.

Overall feel: serene, spacious, and natural. Think of sunlight through linen curtains, earthy tones, and botanical imagery.

Design structure:

Header / Nav bar:

Same as home page (logo, “Home,” “Our Blends,” “About,” “Contact,” “Shop Now”).

Slight scroll shadow for polish.

Hero section:

Headline: “Discover Your Daily Ritual.”

Subline: “Each blend is crafted with care to nurture balance, beauty, and calm from within.”

Background: subtle texture (linen / watercolor).

Product showcase (3 cards or sections):

Glow Ritual:

Description: “Illuminate your inner glow with adaptogenic botanicals and natural antioxidants that support healthy skin and daily energy.”

Highlighted ingredient: Rose hip + Maca root.

Button: “Explore Glow Ritual.”

Calm Restore:

Description: “Ease stress and balance your hormones with gentle herbs that support mood, rest, and inner harmony.”

Highlighted ingredient: Ashwagandha + Chamomile.

Button: “Explore Calm Restore.”

Vital Greens:

Description: “Daily nourishment from organic greens, prebiotics, and minerals for energy, clarity, and vitality.”

Highlighted ingredient: Spirulina + Wheatgrass.

Button: “Explore Vital Greens.”

Each product should include a rounded photo (or placeholder), soft hover effect, and short poetic tagline (e.g., “Your glow begins within”).

Ingredients & Benefits section:

Soft background block with an infographic-style layout or icons for key benefits (Energy, Hormone Balance, Calm Mind, Radiant Skin).

Include short, one-line descriptions under each icon.

Call to Action section:

Background gradient (sage → blush).

Text: “Bring balance home.”

Subtext: “Experience the difference in every blend.”

Buttons: “Shop All” and “Join Our Ritual.”

Footer:

Same as home page, minimal and soft.

Design language:

Maintain same font pairing: Playfair Display (headings) + Inter (sans body).

Use 3-column grid on desktop, stacked layout on mobile.

Include smooth scroll animations (fade-in / slide-up) for each product section.

Keep generous white space.

Tech stack:

HTML + Tailwind CSS (preferred).

Responsive and accessible.

Add alt text for product images and semantic structure for SEO.

SEO metadata:
