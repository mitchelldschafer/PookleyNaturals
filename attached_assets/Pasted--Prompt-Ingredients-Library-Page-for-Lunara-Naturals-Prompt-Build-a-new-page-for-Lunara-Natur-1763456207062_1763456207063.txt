🌿 Prompt: “Ingredients Library” Page for Lunara Naturals

Prompt:
Build a new page for Lunara Naturals called “Ingredients Library” — a calm, elegant glossary of the herbs and botanicals used in our blends.

The page should feel like a soft, modern herbal encyclopedia: spacious, readable, and rooted in nature. It should visually match the existing Lunara pages (same header, footer, fonts, and color palette: warm neutrals, sage, blush, ivory).

Overall layout & vibe:

Use the same nav/header and footer as the Home and Our Blends pages.

Keep lots of white space, gentle section dividers, and subtle scroll animations (fade-up, low motion).

Typography: elegant serif for headings, clean sans-serif for body text.

Page structure:

Hero Section – “The Heart of Our Blends”

Headline: “The Heart of Our Blends.”

Subtext: “Every Lunara formula begins with thoughtfully chosen botanicals, rooted in tradition and guided by modern wellness.”

Soft background (gradient or texture) with a minimal botanical illustration or image of herbs on linen.

Intro Copy Block

Short paragraph explaining why ingredients matter (purity, intentionality, women’s wellness, gentle support).

One highlighted sentence in italics, e.g., “When you know what’s inside, you can trust what you feel.”

Ingredients Grid / Library

Create a responsive grid of ingredient cards (2–3 columns on desktop, single column on mobile).

For each ingredient, include:

Ingredient name (e.g., “Ashwagandha”)

Short subtitle / category (e.g., “Adaptogen · Calm & Stress Support”)

2–3 sentence description in plain language explaining:

What it is

Why it’s used

How it supports women’s wellness

A small icon or illustration placeholder (leaf, root, flower, etc.).

Example ingredients to include:

Ashwagandha – adaptogen for stress, calm, resilience.

Chamomile – soothing flower for rest and relaxation.

Maca Root – supports energy and hormone balance.

Rose Hip – vitamin C rich; supports skin and glow.

Spirulina – nutrient-dense algae for energy & vitality.

Wheatgrass – greens for detox and daily nourishment.

Lemon Balm – calming herb for an easeful mind.

Holy Basil (Tulsi) – adaptogen for clarity and calm.

Each card should feel like a mini profile, not too clinical — warm, accessible language.

Filter / Tag Row (Optional but nice)

Add a small row of filter “chips” or tags near the top of the grid, such as:

“Calm & Mood”

“Energy & Vitality”

“Hormone Balance”

“Skin & Glow”

These don’t need to be fully functional filters yet; they can just visually categorize ingredients (e.g., each card shows a small tag like “Calm & Mood”).

Safety & Transparency Note

Add a gentle section near the bottom with a soft background.

Heading: “Gentle, Honest, Transparent.”

2–3 short bullet points on:

No harsh fillers

Third-party testing or “crafted with intention” (can be placeholder copy)

A reminder that supplements are not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Call to Action – “Explore Our Blends”

Final CTA band that ties the ingredients back to your products:

Text: “Ready to meet the blends these ingredients call home?”

Button: “Explore Our Blends” linking to the Products / Our Blends page.

Copywriting style:

Warm, clear, and grounded; not overly scientific.

Avoid medical claims; focus on supportive language like “may support,” “traditionally used for,” “known to help with.”

Use short, soothing lines where appropriate, for example:

“Small leaves. Big comfort.”

“Grown in the earth. Chosen for you.”

Technical details:

Use HTML + TailwindCSS (or clean CSS) and minimal JS for animations.

Make the grid fully responsive (mobile-first).

Use semantic tags like <main>, <section>, <article> for each ingredient card.

Add descriptive alt text for any images/illustrations.

Include basic SEO meta tags for this page:

Title: “Ingredients Library | Lunara Naturals – Botanicals for Women’s Wellness”

Description: “Explore the herbs and botanicals inside Lunara Naturals’ blends — thoughtfully chosen to support calm, energy, and balance.”
