🌿 Prompt: “Our Rituals” Page for Lunara Naturals

Prompt:
Build a new page for Lunara Naturals called “Our Rituals”.

This page should feel like a calm, guided experience that shows women how to weave Lunara supplements into their daily life. Think of it as a digital ritual guide — soft, nurturing, and beautifully designed.

Overall aesthetic & structure:

Keep the same brand styling as the existing Lunara pages: warm neutrals, sage greens, blush accents, elegant serif headings, clean sans-serif body text.

Maintain the same header/nav and footer as the other pages so the site feels unified.

Use spacious sections with soft separators and gentle scroll animations (fade-in + slight upward motion).

The tone should be soothing, affirming, and slightly poetic.

Page layout:

Hero Section – “Welcome to Your Ritual”

Headline: “Welcome to Your Ritual.”

Subtext: “Small, loving choices add up to a life in balance.”

Background: subtle texture or soft gradient (sage → cream).

Add a simple illustration or image of a calm morning scene (tea, sunlight, plants).

Morning Ritual Section – “Rise & Glow”

Title: “Morning Ritual · Rise & Glow”

Two-column layout:

Left: short paragraph describing a gentle, slow morning routine featuring Glow Ritual (e.g., “Stir one scoop into water or a warm latte, take three deep breaths, set an intention for your day.”).

Right: simple step list (1–2–3) with icons for each step (drink, breathe, intention).

Add a soft highlight box with an affirmation like: “Today, I choose energy that feels gentle, not rushed.”

Midday Reset Section – “Breathe & Restore”

Title: “Midday Ritual · Breathe & Restore”

Focus on Calm Restore.

Describe a quick midday pause: sip Calm Restore, walk away from screens, stretch, breathe.

Use a horizontal card layout with:

Short copy (“For the moments when your mind feels loud.”)

A mini checklist: hydrate, breathe, unplug for 5 minutes.

Evening Wind-Down Section – “Rest & Renew”

Title: “Evening Ritual · Rest & Renew”

Incorporate Vital Greens as part of a nourishing evening habit or gentle nightly support.

Include a 3-step visual timeline (e.g., “Slow Down”, “Nourish”, “Unplug”) with simple icons and 1–2 sentences under each.

Add a soft quote block: “You are allowed to rest. Your body is allowed to exhale.”

Ritual Tips & Micro-Habits Section

Grid of 4–6 small “ritual tips” cards, such as:

“Light a candle before your supplement.”

“Pair your blend with journaling.”

“Leave your bottle where you’ll see it.”

“Attach your ritual to something you already do (coffee, skincare, etc.).”

Each card should be simple, with a small icon and 1–2 lines of text.

Call to Action – “Begin Your Ritual”

Soft background band in blush/sage.

Headline: “Begin Your Ritual.”

Subtext: “Choose the blend that meets you where you are.”

Buttons:

“Explore Our Blends” (links to products page)

“Join Our Ritual” (links to email sign-up on home page or opens a simple form).

Copywriting style:

Short, gentle sentences.

Focus on feelings of calm, balance, and self-trust.

Example lines:

“Your ritual doesn’t have to be perfect. It just has to be yours.”

“One sip. One breath. One small act of care.”

Technical details:

Use HTML + TailwindCSS (or clean CSS) and minimal JavaScript for scroll animations.

Make the page fully responsive (mobile-first).

Use semantic tags (<main>, <section>, <header>, <footer>) and descriptive aria labels where helpful.

Add alt text for any images or illustrations.

Comment the code to explain major layout sections (hero, morning ritual, midday reset, evening, tips, CTA) so it’s easy to adjust later.
